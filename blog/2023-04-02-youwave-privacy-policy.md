# YouWave: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the YouWave app for Android!

This is a proprietary Android app developed by Chien Tran. The app is available on Google Play.

As a loyal Android user, I take care of user privacy carefully.

## Data privacy

YouWave Android collects personal data including email addresses and User Unique identifiers to authorize user
privileges and personalize user experience.

There will be paid subscription plan in the future so financial information will be required when the premium features
arrived.

YouWave only stores the processed version of your assets including audio files. All intermediate resources are removed
after the processing and we don't collect your original digital assets.

Users can choose to help us with the app Crashlytics and diagnosis by sending app info and performance. The data sent is
handled by Firebase Crashlytics and Performance.

We intentionally collect your app interactions so that we can make the app more eligible and usable which would help
improve user experience.

We intentionally collect your search history so that we can personalize your user experience.

Users can always review, enable or disable app interactions and search history data collection.

By removing your audio from the app, your audio file and related information are completely removed from our server.

In the future, the application will allow the user to delete their account. By then, all user-related information and
assets are completely removed from our servers.

All private information is not exposed or shared with any other users or third-party organization except the `handle` you specify yourself. If you find yourself or other people's information getting leaked, please contact us using the `Contact information` provided at the bottom of this document so that we can fix the issue.

## Changes

This privacy policy may be updated along with the development and evolution of the app. Updates will be explicitly
notified to the users via email and in-app dialog and the updating date will be marked.

## Contact information

If you would like to contact us to understand more about this Policy or wish to contact us concerning any matter
relating to individual rights and your Personal Information, you may send an email to [chientrm@gmail.com](mailto:chientrm@gmail.com).
