The Shell
Into the deepest darkest secrets inside each human mind.

The first shell
Humans are so devastated to find their shells for future intentions. On the very first day of existence, humans were meant to seek their descendants as a tool to successive their legacy, properties, attributes, and signatures. We’re willing to kill thousands just to save one of our kind. We’re eager to destroy castles to castles just to clarify our honor, to claim our superior, and save the last drops of our own.
The human was never tempted to express their shelf because, by expression, individuals can try to climb up the stair of pride and prejudice. The more you show up your attributes, the more people tend to kneel and soothe down. Expression is the most beautiful interaction god ever made. Anybody even at the lowest level of credit, by screaming and breaking furniture, can gain attention and the fearsomeness of the surroundings. At certain levels of destruction, fears and respect are achieved.
At the root of seldom, one is not hesitant to force other people to follow their path, to eat, sleep, work, and think the way they do. They’re willing to abuse, torture, or kill just to make sure one of their thoughts is to be committed to the next generations, no matter how bad it is. Humans are so afraid of losing their thoughts, the idea that people will forget about them, their contribution, and negate their success. The truth is, everybody will be forgotten someday, sooner or later. No matter who you are, how rich you were, how successful you were, how famous you were, and how much did you influence society, you will still be forgotten.
The second thoughts, these people are so strong in their own opinions and beliefs. No sticks or stones can break their faith in what is good and what is not. Their intermediate perception of life is immutable. And they’re not tempted to kill for that. A human belief so diverged into good and evil. Our minds have a clear line separated between black and white. No mountain is heavier than our cognition, no river is longer than our sights. We’re are persisted rock of solid. And when the stone is challenged, we bounce back as hard as we can to cause as much damage as we are hurting ourselves just to protect our minds.
There were no first shells, the shelling mechanism existed before history, before our first words, first images, and first words. It was one of the inheritance mechanisms which does not require the successor to share genetic information with the predecessor, which we called artificial selection.
Long before books and songs, words and poems, humans found the best way to belonging their will, is to brainwash other people. Each one of us was a perfect shell. When we are born, we can learn anything from scratch, and we believe in those who lie and act the way we are told to. We are not curious or question what has been taught because we’re artificially selected to avoid unexpected feedback. The ones who are not willing to be silent will be reclassified, regrouped, and specifically treated. The current generation of humans is perfected and adjusted to a rate that we can both inherit from our predecessors and fight back at the same time. The idea is to make sure that we’re moving forward without breaking the whole society or at least breaking it but we can still rebuild them after all. As a result, not every innovation is welcome, and not every legacy is maintained. If the rate bend toward innovation too much, human will move too fast that we can collapse anytime without the required resources to get up a gain. On the other hand, if the rate bend toward legacy maintenance, it would take centuries for the next revolution to rise. However, the rate is not to be balanced between those too, but a little bit biased to innovative trends. Because without sufficient changes, society will fall back into primitive ages. Innovation is a micronutrient that we can not live without.
How much of a shell?
After all, we are all shells. Maybe you think you are original and handmade, but the truth is, we are all shells! We are ninety-nine percent of our predecessors and only one percent of ourselves. Humans have existed for over 300,000 years while the average life expectancy is only 72.6 years recently. If you divide the life expectancy by 300,000 years, we’re only 0.02% of our own. But does human exists in a linear time-space? The answer is no! Most of the gadgets and tools were using today have only been invented in the last 200 years. The feudal and prehistory ages contribute zero to nothing compared to the industrial age. But you’re wrong again. Life and history are more than just tablets and smartphones.
Long before silicon materials, humans have so much more to do with their daily tasks. We’re so doomed to arts and deep thinking. Even though the limitation of a small economy and range of research, humans dug down very deep into what we can imagine. Nowadays, we’re still living around those products include religious, arts of war, the holiness of gods, and the stupidity of how people treated each other. We mined the meanest and finest of all ores. We learned how to do the smallest things. We studied how to write the simplest letter. We practice how to move the slightest steps and kill precious life. When natural resources remained natural, human life was the only thing which is unlimited and as flexible as human thought. We spend thousands of years researching and practicing how to deal with each other to get the most we can and spend the least we want. We were living in a zero-sum world where the only factor which influences that sum is the count of lives and deaths.
6000 years since the earliest cradles of civilizations, the shelling mechanism is heavily challenged by technologies. No man could ever imagine a single piece of metal and plastic can revert the process of brainwashing. Nowadays, no Adolf Hitler can raise the angriness of people because, by a single slide of a finger, a human can access millions of books, billions of articles, and trillions of posts/feeds. Most of the premodern history legacies need to be transformed and converted into new forms to survive the days of millennials. In old age, the death of a member can drag down the whole family into poverty and slavery. In our age, one can make thousands of dollars with little to nothing required. Salvation and starvation are no longer a threat to most of the population. People are kinder and more open, and most of us are willing to share food and cloth. Brainwashing was no longer an effective technique for the shelling mechanism.
